# 📈 Predictive Modeling: Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

## 🔍 Objective
Build a predictive model to forecast monthly sales based on historical data using linear regression techniques.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 Methodology
1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building with Linear Regression  
5. Model Evaluation using RMSE and R² Score  
6. Visualization of Predictions vs Actuals  

## ✅ Outcome
- Developed a linear regression model that forecasts sales with good accuracy.  
- Visualized trends and residual errors to understand model performance.

## 📁 Files Included
- `business statistics analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full analysis and model building  
- `business statistics analysis.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing  
- `visuals/` — Folder containing charts like sales trends and error plots
